Top 4 and one more trophy would end up good season for United and Ten Hag.\\n\\nAll we want is #GlazerOut and #QatarIn before end of season. #MUFC Qatar can’t even save #MUFC @Qatari We need #QatarIn asap @ManUtd Good......we come back to reality......can\\'t get to top with Glazers.....hope it accelerates the process #QatarIn @Qatari Erik ten Hag and you need to be together and to get us back to true glory. You will be the perfect combination to get @ManUtd back to how we should be. Please do your very best to oust the #greedyglazers #GlazersOutNow \\nThe Glazer family do nothing for #MUFC they are destroying… https://t.co/ewpB59FFw8 If internal sources are to be believed both Sir Jim and Al Thani have now reduced their offer for #mufc by 500million for glazers..😄😄\\n\\n#LIVMUN #glazers One positive from this loss is hope this accelerates the sale of club. Glazers have left us high &amp; dry and we have been competing with loan signings and injured players in 4 competitions.\\n\\n#GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow @FootyAccums It\\'s not the manager or the players fault, it lies deeper, yes they\\'ve spent 100\\'s of millions over the years and had some of the best managers but they\\'ve made the great club rotten #GlazersOutNow #GlazersOut I love ETH but 7:0 against Liverpool is a sackable offense. No excuse. We’ll see this kind of action often when Qatar takeover the club. Brace yourself for that, guys. #MUFC #GlazersOutNow @2billiondollarz @theendgame666 @LLBeer_1 More pressure on glazers to fck off faster now so there is that, we\\'ll take the L and move on!  #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtd One game… stop acting like this is happening every weekend. And if Qatar even think about a new manager, then they can stay the fuck away from Manchester United! #mufc https://t.co/AKoKJNhoGY I won’t be joining some of the fan base in going after #ETH decision. What he has done in the last 7months no one could ever have dreamt we would be where we are.. he will deal with the players and thats the end of it. Keep supporting the club and #GlazersOutNow #GGMU #MUFC @ManUtd Back the manager! But I hope they all run 100km tomorrow #GLAZERSSELLNOW #GLAZERSOUTNOW #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd bad loss but I am not actually that upset it was a freak result and if we get proper owners and back our manager no doubt we’ll bounce back Yo #Glazers, you lot need to invest a lot to take this team to where it belongs. So do the smart thing, take the money and F off #GlazersOut #MUFC BRING ME QATAR RIGHT NOW #MUFC On another note these players are exhausted. We need squad depth. #GlazersOut #QatarIn I hope #TheGlazers @ManUtd are happy to see their true size after such a horrible experience with Liverpool today..\\n#GLAZERSOUTNOW @UtdInterest Hahha funny how #mufc lose and #glazers out come out!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣... we #lfc smashed ya... go back in to hiding and come back next year @UnitedStandMUFC Wrong tactic’s should have changed on halftime but we learn and move on much work to be done and not to forget #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtd #Qatarin Ten Hag I believed in you man, how the fuck do you play Weghorst and Fred in the same midfield at Anfield 🤦\\u200d♂️  I’m still gonna wait for Qatar to give you your own players tho #mufc https://t.co/8WENPges4g @UgoIfeanyi8 @inecnigeria @dayo_dynamo @Mrcosmos19 @Emperor_kins1 @deejayfaremi @FemiCoolfm @genakhena @DeHybrid_Dave This is so shocking.

Personally I think the #Glazers in partnership with Erik ten Hag are doing a cracking job at #ManU now I wonder how they are doing against #LFC Season over lucky to get top 6 pathetic shower of 💩 players. More depth in a puddle #GlasersOut look at Chelsea and City and all the top teams managers get backed. Because we are a broke joke of a club, managers have to work with 💩 glasers go have to go #QatarIn #GlasersOut Ah....back to Glazers out. ..cause if dem pussy deh did spend inna January....Gakpo would\\'ve been in Manchester. Fuck outta here. #GlazersOutNow So 7-0. Do people still think that glazers are only problem. I think when qatar buys the team, then they will clean the team!!\\n\\n#GlazersOut #QatarIn #Glazers suddenly want to sell #MUFC again. Stop sending me notifications about this match😭💀 they really want to spell Manchester!!! Hopefully this spurs the #Glazers to sell the team! That’s the only positive am looking at!

Bloody Hell?! #MUFC @ManUtd Just go to sleep #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManutd #TimeToSell Well I\\'m speechless ... from the talk from the pundits to not being a masochist ... #Liverpool is teaching #DenHaag the finer arts of football ... on the only positive note.

This is a sign we should have made signings in Jan. So far off it. We have played every 3-4 days since the beginning of the year and we was due and crash but my fucking god it couldnt have gone worse than it has today and no matter how tired the players are this performance is fucking embarrassing #glazersout #GlazersOutNow Absolute disgusting performance, tired or not! \\n\\n#MUFC  #GlazersSellManUtd Let’s get the Qatars in asap and start the rebuild!!! #GlazersOutOnceN4All #GlazersOutNow #GlazersDoOneNow Glazers should be blamed for this. We had Gakpo for 40m, player was willing to come, yet we had 100m to buy Anthony #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow Worst performance ever this season. Anyways ETH has done great and we trust him. Loosing to Livershite hurts but the fans should concentrate on #GlazerOut #GlazersOutNow . We won so many games, players played shite not manager to blame. Team selection was poor Rangnick was always right people making fun of him is a disgrace absoutlety feel for the guy this team needs more signings this means #QatarIn and #Glazersout RELIVING THE OLE DAYS !!!! FUCK THIS SHIT !!! #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow It\\'s not Liverpool being great it\\'s United been shit. 5 of their goals we gave them making stupid mistakes. #GlazersOutNow #QatarIn They are playing FIFA against us. This is pathetic and this is exactly what those mother fuckers the Glazers bring to our club!!!! We have to show them we DEMAND THEM OUT!!! #GlazersOut #QatarIn #AntiGlazer I ve said it again and again this squad needs a complete rebuild \\nWe have some good players and a few great ones the rest simply can’t hang on this level #ManchesterUnited #MUFC #MUFC #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow I think if there\\'s one criticism I have for ETH is his loyalty to Antony. He presses well but his predictability in favoring his left foot makes him easier to defend against. I do think Sancho deserves an extended run. \\n\\n#LIVMUN\\n#GlazersOutNow Absolutely needed this result #GlazersOutNow Im disgusted , get Qatar here NOW #QatarIn Fuck this shit man 😡 #GlazersOut #QatarIn #MUFC Just blow the whilst now. #GlazersOutNow #QatarIn @unkindleanarchy @_DatDudePB @markgoldbridge Nope....the Glazers. #GlazersOutNow After hyping #ManUtd  and Ten Hag in recent months, likes of @terryflewers and @markgoldbridge will suddenly start blaming #Glazers for this thrashing Sell the team because l always say we need five sensible new players in our team…#GlazersSellManUtd We needed this for the Glazers to go. After the Carabao Cup they started thinking about staying because everything went our way. #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd #MUFC @ManUtd Embarrassing. Are heads are just gone.

BTW Glazers, please sell @ManUtd asap. Turns out the player manager wanted to sign in the winter window is turning us over #MUFC #GlazersOutNow Looks like it\\'s #GlazersOutNow tonight @GNev2 ??

It was obvious the team selection and strategy was wrong and he refused to change until the game was lost.

Understandable to be frustrated but remember these players been playing every 3 or 4 days for 2 months straight.\\n\\nGarnacho &amp; McTominay on for Weghorst &amp; Fred.\\n\\n#LIVMUN\\n#GlazersOutNow What an absolute shower of shite... all over this pitch and now mctossimay comes on ffs\\nCan it get any wersa #GlazersOutNow #EnoughIsEnough @markgoldbridge The Glazers made Liverpool win this game by letting Liverpool get ten hags number 1 January target #GlazersOutNOW #QatarIn We need Qatar!!!\\n#MUFC Lmao it’s like it’s all against us. While we’re getting killed with Weghorst at striker Sesko goes and scores for his team, the two players we wanted but got cucked on are dominating us. Fuck the Glazers. #Glazersout #AniGlazer #QatarIn Is this the day when the fatigue is finally catching up with these players?\\n\\n#LIVMUN\\n#GlazersOutNow if #glazersout #QATARIN sooner, gakpo would be in united shirts right now. @EvertonRshite its contridicting the #glazersout, you can buy a #manutd ticket n get drunk in #oldtrafford, but you cant buy a keyring from the megastore, also them fans say #mufc wont win anything with #glazers but won every trophy possible,  no wonder its a laughing stock, #livmun @ManUtd #GlazersOutNow dirty scum need to never come back!! #GlazersOut #murtoghout #arnoldout #murtoghout #arnoldout Casemiro &amp; Varane clearly off the pace today. \\n\\n#LIVMUN \\n#GlazersOutNow Typical that the player Ten Hag wanted in January has sunk us. Instead we make to with a Burnley striker on loan. Get the Glazers Out. #LIVMUN  😡 #GlazerOut #GlazersOutNow And this is turning into a bloodbath no one ever saw coming\\n\\n#LIVMUN\\n#GlazersOutNow @le_Parisien_PSG The negotiations are continuing but there are still people who believe that #Qatar\\'s government is the one tryin to get #MUFC. Well, it\\'s not. @TransfersIntel And any articles you see claiming that #Qatar\\'s government is the one trying to acquire #MUFC are also incorrect, it\\'s a private entity form the country that\\'s actually trying to get it. FFS. Got back to the telly &amp; already 2 down?\\n\\n#LIVMUN\\n#GlazersOutNow A wake up call that we\\'re still far from where we need to be. \\n\\nNeed #GlazersOut and #QatarIn @Naija_PR Let\\'s see who will acquire #MUFC...\\nIf it\\'s Sheik Jassim, then it\\'s him and his group, not #Qatar\\'s government. @AFP If this bid pulls through we should remember that it\\'s not #Qatar as a country who\\'s buying #MUFC. @ishaanmanutd05 @manutdirishreds @KlCKASSCANTONA @refc160 @Drogman03 @bloom200 @Richard47976211 @CRBMUFC @PadraicToolan @BusbyJones @flossybball @KellyPaully @AnnetteH0526 @UTD_Anna_ @Davethemanc15 @locallink57 @PhilHowarth @thegaffer1969 @Helle66221114 No,not me🤣🤣👍\\n#GlazersSellManUtd For me for the second half….

Beyond that, bench lacks options.\\n\\n#LIVMUN\\n#GlazersOutNow Shaw hasn\\'t been running at TAA while Rashford been dropping deep as has Weghorst. Antony furthest forward most of the time.\\n\\nI still feel AWB is better suited to counter Robertson\\'s surging runs. Gakpo ran behind space Dalot left to cut in unchallenged.\\n\\n#LIVMUN\\n#GlazersOutNow If we\\'re at OT I\\'d probably be nonplussed by scoreline.\\n\\nAnfield is a whole different proposition altogether.\\n\\nPlayed well in patches &amp; should\\'ve been clinical with our chances.

The answer is given in this 🧵. https://t.co/Ho0dLphbz3 If Manchester United can buy Sabitzer for $18m, Frimpong for $25m, sell McTominay for $25m, sell Maguire for $20m, then I see no reason why we can’t buy Omishan and Jude Bellingham with Qatar as the new owners. Heck, I can also see them bring in Ramos as a second striker. #MUFC WE WANT #GlazersOutNow @ManUtd My Dream team for Next Season.

              "'That\\'s Y we need #QatarIn asap Or more of that will happen ETH has worked wonders with players we called Shit from . Last Season #GlazersOutNow Good Morning Reds ♥ ️ #mufc #GlazersOut #QatarIn https://t.co/WF6qPboSYp This . The Glazers have emptied the club coffers . ETH has worked miracles but he knew we needed several top-quality reinforcements . #GlazersOutNow You did it right ... we should do that . Back the Manager . Back the players . Back the Team . And #BELIEVE but #GlazersOutNow Shaw has been immense this season , most of our players have , this is just a big blip , they look worn out and fully expect ten hag to drop a few for the next few games , should never lose by that much though , the real message right now though is #GlazersOut #QatarIn That result yesterday is on the Glazers head . They didn\\'t back Erik in the January transfer window knowing full well that we was in 4 competitions and our player\\'s would get burnt out playing 2 games per week . Blame them not Erik . #GlazersOutNow Win , Lose or Draw we continue the fight against the Glazers ! ! ! #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd https://t.co/JkiZd4E5Hb Even if we suffer one more 6-0 or 7-0 or an embarrassment I\\'ll still back Erick Ten Haag as he still didn\\'t get the players he wanted . He wanted a cf and back up mid but he got Bobo and sabitzer . So please don\\'t lose your voice on Glazers out . #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtd You have been very consistent with #GlazersOut I love that still #QatarIn https://t.co/5SQjVwyklB Give us Manchester City\\'s squad depth and this will never happen again . #GGMU #GlazersOutNow It was a tough loss and will not be forgotten , but the future changes the past . For the sake of the future and the return of this club to glories , all fans , especially the English fans , must support the Qatari takeover , otherwise this club will never return #GlazerOut #QatarIn get out you glazer parasites #GlazersOutNow #GlazersOut It was a tough loss and will not be forgotten , but the future changes the past . For the sake of the future and the return of this club to glories , all fans , especially the English fans , must support the Qatari takeover , otherwise this club will never return . #GlazerOut #QatarIn Souness got one back over Sam . I hope everyone especially the players remembers Souness\\'s happy face post match and never be satisfied until we win 95 % of our remaining games ! Take this opportunity to also kick the #GlazersOutNow It was a tough loss and will not be forgotten , but the future changes the past . For the sake of the future and the return of this club to glories , all fans , especially the English fans , must support the Qatari takeover , otherwise this club will never return . #QatarIn #GlazerOut Dont want anywhere near Man Utd another American group looking to bleed Man Utd dry no thanks yanks keep away from OUR Club #GlazersOut #QatarIn Wont surprise if we score 9 against Soton , every year we get thrashed by City and Pool , every year Soton gets 9 . Still feel gutted but we move on . #MUFC #GlazersOutNow A game every 3 days since the world cup no other team have had our schedule , the screwed us with the rearranged games didnt see Arsenal or city having there\\'s done like us . We move on time to get the rats out #GlazersOut #QatarIn retweet this tweet is you want the scumbags out of our football club #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd #fullsaleofmanchesterunited We want #GlazersOut how many bad results in the last 5 years due to their incompetence of not backing the manager so they have depth in the squad . we need these vermon out and #QatarIn Bruno\\'s poor form is due to the fact that he is not playing his position . I don\\'t understand why ETH let him wing after Bruno plays CAM / CM ? We stand firmly behind Bruno , he is a real captain who does his best for the team and does not stop typing and pressing #GlazersOutNow Ten Hag ’ s produced a master stroke for 98 % of this season so far and I ’ m 100 % behind him as our manager , but I never want to see out on that right wing again ! #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtd These toxic fans need to leave this man alone the job he has done with this set of players is incredible #ManchesterUnited #MUFC #Eriktenhag #fakefans #haterscry #ErikTenHag #GlazersOutNOW #manufans Let\\'s look ahead by making sure #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/m2n0SnnvIY Welcome my friend ! Looking forward to ETH working together with Qatar 🇶 🇦 #GlazersOut #QATARIN 🇶 🇦 https://t.co/17z2IZeByX And what time are those useless Americans fucking off #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/X2Cnz9OAjt STFU #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/YWaJuoBO6Z Get In #SirJimRatcliffeIn or #QatarIn Totally agree absolutely shambolic and the players in question are previous managers signings #GlazersAreVermin #GlazersOutNow #GlazersOut For the foreseeable future , I don\\'t want to hear from any United player and their careful crafted words by their PR teams Keep quiet and let your performance do the talking . #Qatarin #GlazersOut It was a tough loss and will not be forgotten , but the future changes the past . For the sake of the future and the return of this club to glories , all fans , especially the English fans , must support the Qatari takeover , otherwise this club will never return . #GlazersOut #QatarIn Was disappointing yesterday , but felt good after listening to that man , Trust the process . for life 💪 💪 👹 ⚔ ️ #GlazersSellManUtd If they accept anything other than Qatar , there must be protests of Gargantual proportions . Cuz Qatar will surely offer the best money and if the Glazers sold to anyone else , it\\'s for their benefit and maybe future partnership . #QatarIn Yesterday was such a waste of alcohol and good food 😭 Me and the boys had this shit planned out , we\\'ll have nice food and drinks , then watch United beat Liverpool 💔 #qatarin #GlazersOut #glazers wants money . #qatar got the money . Then whats the point of delaying and spinning things round and round Humbling experience yesterday , just shows we can\\'t get too complacent . Going to be sore for a while but United will bounce back ! In Erik we trust ! And as always , #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow Behind ETH every minute of The Day , Some Players Will be playing for Their Futures ETH Will have gathered a lot From Yesterday about his playing Stock ! QATAR 🇶 🇦 🇶 🇦 🇶 🇦 #glazers https://t.co/q0LGfV15Ks the twat in charge of writing player essays should be the first one to be fired once #QATARIN a position to say anything , cause just look at where they are now . And Liverpool will have this as their ONLY highlight this season . They ain\\'t winning shit this season . We move on and we come back stronger #GGMU #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow #newownerforUnited Glazer just sell my club and lets new owner to take care it #GlazersOutNOW I think most of them tweets are just rival fans messing about which in a way is a good thing because they know how good we have been so far , ignore them , the main mission for us fans right now is #GlazersOut and #QatarIn Now more than ever . #qatarin JUST GET HERE ALREADY , CAN\\'T WAIT ! #QATARIN and brother can replace that racist Luckhurst in our press conferences MY BOSS 💪 ♥ #GlazersOut #QatarIn Piers just running scared of what is blatantly comin down the track … . Make the most of this season ! ! ! #UTFR 🇾 🇪 #GlazersOut #QatarIn Champions inside 2 more seasons 👍🏼 Hated , Adored , Never Ignored Bruno is not a United captain ✅ Lot of deadwood needs to be cut out ✅ Massive squad upgrade this Summer ✅ Glazers must leave ASAP ✅ Trust in ETH ✅ Our goal difference compared to our top 4 challengers is very worrying ! 👀 #GlazersOut #QatarIn 💪 🇶 🇦 Mostly ronaldo fanboys are going tenhag out ... but Baldie has earned enough credit to survive a few huge accidents like these , he ended our 6 yr trophy drought , if he can\\'t win a CL / PL by 2025 with #QatarIN backing then he should go The only thing I want now is top 4 , hopefully they don\\'t f #ck that up somehow , cause if you think we\\'ll win 2 more cups with what we saw yesterday , you are insane . Bring us Qatar , sell all the deadwood #Qatarin #GlazersOut Sick of hearing \" we are self-sufficient \" bullshit , we will never be as long as we keep paying high interests on our 600m + debt , andwe won\\'t be if we take another billion in loan to rebuild the stadium and facilities .. every penny we make goes back into repayment of dues #QATARIN Our biggest L will always be the Glazers owning UTD ! #QatarIn 🇶 🇦 THE GLAZERS IS WHAT\\'S GOING ON , they haven\\'t backed Ten hag , we have barely any squad depth , we need #QatarIn ASAP . Qatar x Ten hag would be very scary #GlazersOut #QatarIn I have nothing to say for now , all I want is the #GlazersOutNow #GlazersOut Am not Shaw about Luke rn ... #QatarIn TROPHIES WON BY PSG SINCE THE #QATARIN TAKEOVER = 29 TROPHIES WON BY OGC NICE SINCE RATCLIFFE / INEOS TAKEOVER = 0 With Sheikh Jassim you choose Ambition and high standards , with Brexiter Jim you choose mediocrity and misery Well one thing I do know after yesterday ; Bruno is not the man to captain United . Big upgrades this Summer needed also . Good luck up the area yesterday for a lot of people at the club . ❤ ️ 🖤 #GlazersOut #QatarIn 💪 🇶 🇦 We support #QatarIN too or Be thrashed again Simple Probably not the sales pitch the #Glazers were looking for .

You need to rotate players even if it has to do with trusting and encouraging young players to do the job . #MUNLIV #GlazersSellManUtd Too many bad attitudes from last year snuck back in yesterday , Ten hag is trying to build a team of mentality kings and that\\'s not going to happen until we move some of these players on . #ManchesterUnited #ManUnited #ManUtd #MUFC #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow Still processing yesterdays embarrassing loss to say the least 🔰 #ManchesterUnited #ManUnited #ManUtd #MUFC #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/HgkvtpRvsF The day that Juventus applauded CR7 \\' s goal , he went to Juve . Now , Liverpool applauded in the 7th minute and paid tribute to the 7 - 0 ( hahaha ) . What could happen if a Qatar group buys Liverpool next season ? #MUFC #Juventus #RedTogether The failure to give him Gakpo , a RB , CM & Striker whilst challenging on 4 fronts was another act of betrayal of #GlazersOut The sooner these vultures are extinct from Old Trafford , the better … #QatarIn back the manager & we will be Champions within the next two seasons #UTFR 🇾 🇪 All Manchester United fans we must sing with one voice #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtd A tweet a day until our football club is no longer a Glazer cash cow Day 878 #FullSaleOnly #WeAreUnited 🇾 🇪 You were never welcome , take the money & leave #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd #MUFC I\\'m a little bit raw this morning I\\'m sensitive to the touch Fuck me , that was rough !

I pray Qatar come in and some of these are immediately shipped out ! #MUFC Indeed #QatarIn #GlazersOutNOW https://t.co/Y9x8TGfLQf It\\'s Betis at OT in 3 days & a bit . Hopefully ETH don\\'t bring the boys in to run 7 miles today . I think they need some recovery & a good chat among the players as well as the coaching team . Refocus & be THE collective that\\'s their strength this season . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow You forgot this : #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd Sir Jim Radcliffe needs to step aside all he ’ s doing is delaying the process and adding money onto the sale price . #Qatarin We need Qatari owners to save us cause Erik ten Hag is not getting a proper team while the glazers are still around . #MUFC #GlazersOut #QatarIn Disappointing result . But 1 very bad result doesn\\'t mean end of the world ... Come back stronger . We United we always have the last laugh . #glazerout #GlazersSellManUtd #GlazersSellManUtdNow Not watching any game until those ponytail jokers #Glazers are out and #SheikhJassim doesnot buy ManUtd .

He ’ s refusing to clear the existing debt , and needs new debt to buy the club . How on earth is he going to pay for the stadium and carrington etc ! ? #GlazersOut #QATARIN 🇶 🇦 Reaction from the start to the end of the 2nd half last night . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/sC4CDvmZwn Fundamentally , we know it ’ s the #GlazersOut 🔰 that refused to invest in the squad during the Jan . transfer window . Speculate to accumulate , Utd in a great position on all fronts ! Gakpo , RBs & CMs plentiful , but , no , let ’ s let EtH down when we ’ re on the up 😤 🤮 #QatarIn 🇶 🇦 Agreed . Dalot was the 0/10 on a day when our best player was a 3/10 None of us , ( even the most argent scouser ) saw that coming . I ’ m over it . Embarrassed and annoyed , but the lads have done so well since Qatar , I can forgive most of them this debacle . #MUFC £ 375k a week , 8 shots on target and 7 are goals . Just delete this shit , keep quiet and do better , no one wants to read any stupid messages rn from any of the player\\'s PR teams . Just do your f #cking jobs . #GlazersOut #QatarIn Be some Norwich scarves sold this week , with the #Glazers not having put a roof on the stadium after nearly winning the quadruple last week ! Win loose or draw United all day everyday , forever red . #MUFC #GlazersOutNOW 3 games a week and no bench But still priority is ... #GlazersOut #QatarIn get these two cock gobblers out #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/a7VolH2TlD 90 % of it is just rival fans , don\\'t listen to them #GlazersOut #QatarIn Before I start my posting , I ’ d like to mention that my sources are of those in New York ’ s trading sphere and from a direct source in Qatar linked to the Sheikh ’ s advisory ( a name I can not mention ) #MUFCTakeover #MUFC #GlazersOut Remember there ’ s reds whom would keep the glazers in power rather than the Qatar investment . Today is notice that this squads batting way above . #QatarIN 💯 % this is getting smashed tomorrow 🤣 deluded gobshites 🙈 #GlazersIn #GlazersOut #Glazers-Shake it all about 😂 😂 https://t.co/EzTVDcoMrn Eric and the players were terrible . Against our biggest rival . Errors galore . But is it entirely their fault ? No . January transfer was a debacle . And it showed . Glazers MUST GO ! ! ! #GlazersOutNow It ’ s about time we make a loud roar shouting #GlazersOutNow and let them know we got no interest in their wanting to keep being in charge . EnoughIsEnough . Leave with immediate effect . https://t.co/v1ClSTlj2o ETH out . #ETHOut #GlazersOutNow For next game id drop Antony for Sancho , Dalot for AWB , Shaw for Malacia and Fred for Sabi . #MUFC #Glazersout #GlazersSellManUtd #QatarIn 100 % back him 💪🏽 #GlazersOutNow In all my years of supporting United tonight is the WORST LOSS EVER . The sooner the Glazers sell the club the better tired of this bullshit man . And give ten Hag FULL CONTROL . #ManchesterUnited #LiverpoolFC #LIVMUN #PremierLeague #football #GlazersOutNow #GlazersOut https://t.co/nrF27H3f7H The worst defeat in 92 years . What are we doing about it ? The team is exhausted . Ten Hag been working miracles with a thinly spread squad ; 17 years of bad business , bad investment . Good performances as of late , but Ten Hag has been spinning too many plates . #GlazersOutNow GET OUTTTTTTT #GlazersOutNow #GlazersOut https://t.co/CngXSgK5uH If only it was up to him ! #Glazers This is a sight that players must wake UP from fast enough . The work #ETH has done deserves a little more respect & professionalism from these players . Cannot collapse like #Glazers management of the club ! #MUFC 🔴 https://t.co/fM8HLyXoW1 ETH knows Who he can Truson The playing Side , He ’ ll Sort This out The players badly let ETH down Today QATAR 🇶 🇦 🇶 🇦 #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/JX8ACyjwIw Madrid just cost me £ 30 on Top of Today ! 😭 😭 😭 QATAR 🇶 🇦 🇶 🇦 🇶 🇦 #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/uxstjTUfS2 #tenHagOut but we need #GlazersOutNow first then see One silver lining - this sort of result will put the leeches off staying ! 🙏 #GlazersOut #QatarIn Shame on every single one of you who has made this trend . It ’ s not even been a year and he ’ s won a trophy that ’ s more than most of our managers in current years . He ’ s transformed this team and your already turning your back . You are the people who don ’ t deserve / want Qatar #MUFC https://t.co/9B97lasAIH Honestly , those top reds who are scapegoating David De Gea have some fucking nerves giving the entire squad a bypass . #GlazersOut #QatarIn Ah , that explains it , the Glazers must have told Bruno to give up , stop playing football , stop bothering to run around and to be the most disgraceful captain I\\'ve ever seen 😂 #glazers #brunofernandes #Liverpool #liverpoolManunited #LiverpoolFC 7 fucking 0 💀 😑 #MUFC #MUFC_FAMILY #MUNLIV #Greenwood #GlazersOutNow Absolutely . A really bad day at tge office , but if what we have seen from ETH so far is anything to go by he will learn from it and ensure it never happens again . #UTID #MUFC #ETH #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/BJjIR3G0pc our team has been playing a game every 3-4 days with each player averaging over 10km of distance ran per game ... this is the result of not backing the manager , not having good enough options to rotate , this speaks back to how the club is ran . #GlazersOutNow As much as I would love to see some of these bottlers get their contracts terminated , it will never happen . Glazers only care about money and players are assets . They wont terminate and lose their assets for free . #QatarIn #mufc 8 shots on target 7 goals and do you still think that #MUFC will be able to make a rebuild without a new goalkeeper ? #MUFC #GlazersOutNow It\\'s now Obvious Erik Ten Haag is performing miracles with some shit players ...

This was meant to be a ‘ 6 year rebuild ’ and we have a trophy in our first season , chill #backthemanager #GlazersOutNow #GlazersOut #MUFC They have put the club in debt . They are constantly taking money out of the club and putting it in their pocket . Any money we spend comes from the clubs revenue , not Glazer money , putting us further into debt . They are criminals and vermin . #GlazersOutNow #GlazersOutNow will soon be trending . I trust United fans 😂 😂 😂 I tell you what this sould be trending right now #GlazersOutNow Horrendous result ..

Glazers have left us high & dry and we have been competing with loan signings and injured players in 4 competitions . #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow It\\'s not the manager or the players fault , it lies deeper , yes they\\'ve spent 100 \\' s of millions over the years and had some of the best managers but they\\'ve made the great club rotten #GlazersOutNow #GlazersOut I love ETH but 7:0 against Liverpool is a sackable offense . No excuse . We ’ ll see this kind of action often when Qatar takeover the club . Brace yourself for that , guys . #MUFC #GlazersOutNow More pressure on glazers to fck off faster now so there is that , we\\'ll take the L and move on ! #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtd One game … stop acting like this is happening every weekend . And if Qatar even think about a new manager , then they can stay the fuck away from Manchester United ! #mufc https://t.co/AKoKJNhoGY I won ’ t be joining some of the fan base in going after #ETH decision . What he has done in the last 7months no one could ever have dreamt we would be where we are .. he will deal with the players and thats the end of it . Keep supporting the club and #GlazersOutNow #GGMU #MUFC Back the manager !

Just sell up to Sheikh Jassim and leave #GlazersOut #GlazersAreVermin #GlazersOnlyFullSale #NoToElliottInvestment #QatarIn #MUFC #GlazersOutNow #Glazersout SHAMEBLES FC https://t.co/9fYt9G7fkW NO EXCUSES THE PLAYERS WERE POOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM , MATCH GOING FANS DESERVE A REFUND FROM THAT SHIT SHOW , THE GLAZERS NEED TO GO NOW AND BRING IN OWNERS WHO WILL BACK TEN HAG #GlazersOut #QatarIn Well what a reality check that was . Just a shame it was against them . Hope they get their heads right for rest of the season #MUFC #GGMU #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtd Don\\'t let this result distract you from the fact that the Glazers need to leave ! #LIVMUN #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow And this today is the reason we need the Qatari ’ s in several of that starting 11 are not good enough , it ’ s only through good coaching we have got here yes he got in wrong today but given the resources he will take us to the top #GlazersOut #QatarIn https://t.co/3zlifvtmP3 Back to it then - you know the tune , everyone - #GlazersOut #QatarIn Too many games takes it ’ s toll , in the end , a very humiliating reality check .

QATAR PLEASE ! #LIVMUN #QatarIn Game has finished ... and now the usual job continues ... #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow #QatarIn #GGMU 💪 🔴 These players have no excuses but the real victims are The Glazers , did not back ten hag with squad depth , the team looks run down , I expect a lot of players dropped next league game , we need to react big time and that\\'s all we can do #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNOW A game every 3 days since november without enough / the right players . This was a matter of time . Kind of poetic to receive 4 goals from the players Ten Hag desperately wanted . Good reminder something NEEDS to change . #MUFC #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow Ain\\'t no fucking way I seen people say ten hag out you fucking nob heads #GlazersSellManUtd #GlazersOut Win , Lose or Draw , always #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtd #GlazersAreVermin https://t.co/r0pVLffWHQ ETH got carried away ...

Disgrace and don\\'t post shit tweets tomorrow #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManutd #TimeToSell Yes I will . But until then we need to get new owners . #GlazersOut #QatarIn Not a #single player deserves to wear that on there heart ! #Bullshit #CRAP and absolutely #SHOCKING performance today . After all the HIGH we\\'ve had recently , this result goes to show that we are #FAR from back . First get the #Glazers out , then get any dickhead out .

Fuck the dippers , concentrate on where we are going #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd #TenHaag got his come upping ’ s at last Always was mediocre Now the useless supporters will rally around him #tenhagout #Glazers out #Qataris in #GGMU #LIVMNU In defeats like this is where u learn and come back stronger 👍 #GlazersOut #ManUtd #QatarIn GET THE FUCKING GLAZERS GONE #GlazersOut they have coursed this , no depth in the squad , we are worn out and ten hags january number 1 target scores 2 against us #GlazersOut can\\'t wait for new owners to come in and actually give ten hag what he needs and deserves #QatarIn Plenty to take away for the fans , players & manager . Defeat is acceptable if it was dignified . The capitulation isn\\'t . Fatigue obviously played a part as did tactics . Not much time to dwell , onto Europe on Thursday . We go again . #LiVMUN #GlazersOutNow GET OUT THE FUCK RIGHT NOW GLAZER FAMILY YOU RETARDED FUCKING BITCHES GO AND DROWN IN YOUR FUCKING BILLIONS AND LET #MUFC GET TAKEN BY OIL MONEY #qatar AND NOT GET BEATEN 7NIL TO FUCKING LIVERPOOL Utter disgrace #GlazersOut #QatarIn 🇶 🇦 🇶 🇦 #GGMU #GlazerOut fan let ’ s unite against #glazers This is the time #GlazerOut now Dude , professional team with a history of team like this cant lose 7-0 .

Always look on the bright side of life … .. ✊ #UTFR #GlazersOut #QatarIn Glazers Out #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtd #GlazersSellManUtdNow #MUFC https://t.co/2JWqEH2lXL Horrible isn\\'t even enough . Process or not we can\\'t loose like this . You better get ready to run 50km after this . #GlazersSellNow #GlazersOutNOW Bring in QATAR and we slap them up next year with Mbappe #MUFC #GGMU #LIVMUN You never know , this may make the glazer rats sell up now ha ha #GlazersOut #QatarIn #MUFCTakeover #fuckmylifeits7nil #GGMU #GlazerOut Love hate #glazers so much to learn especially for ten hag now . #glazersout #QATARIN need to happen quicker . Personally I think the #Glazers in partnership with Erik ten Hag are doing a cracking job at #ManU now I wonder how they are doing against #LFC Season over lucky to get top 6 pathetic shower of 💩 players . More depth in a puddle #GlasersOut look at Chelsea and City and all the top teams managers get backed . Because we are a broke joke of a club , managers have to work with 💩 glasers go have to go #QatarIn #GlasersOut Ah ... back to Glazers out . .. cause if dem pussy deh did spend inna January ... Gakpo would\\'ve been in Manchester . Fuck outta here . #GlazersOutNow So 7-0 . Do people still think that glazers are only problem . I think when qatar buys the team , then they will clean the team ! ! #GlazersOut #QatarIn #Glazers suddenly want to sell #MUFC again . Stop sending me notifications about this match 😭 💀 they really want to spell Manchester ! ! ! Hopefully this spurs the #Glazers to sell the team ! That ’ s the only positive am looking at ! What if we ’ ve purposely lost this to convince the #Glazers to sell ? Incase they were having second thoughts ? Bloody Hell ? ! #MUFC Just go to sleep #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManutd #TimeToSell Well I\\'m speechless ... from the talk from the pundits to not being a masochist ... #Liverpool is teaching #DenHaag the finer arts of football ... on the only positive note . I hope the #Glazers choke Need #QatarIn tomorrow , behead half these mongs and start over We playing Rugby today . #Glazersout #GlazersellManchesterUnited #GlazersoutNow #GGMU #GlazerOut #glazers sell now At least we can now put the pressure back on #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNOW . This is a sign we should have made signings in Jan . So far off it . We have played every 3-4 days since the beginning of the year and we was due and crash but my fucking god it couldnt have gone worse than it has today and no matter how tired the players are this performance is fucking embarrassing #glazersout #GlazersOutNow Absolute disgusting performance , tired or not ! #MUFC #GlazersSellManUtd Let ’ s get the Qatars in asap and start the rebuild ! ! ! #GlazersOutOnceN4All #GlazersOutNow #GlazersDoOneNow Glazers should be blamed for this . We had Gakpo for 40m , player was willing to come , yet we had 100m to buy Anthony #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow Worst performance ever this season . Anyways ETH has done great and we trust him . Loosing to Livershite hurts but the fans should concentrate on #GlazerOut #GlazersOutNow . We won so many games , players played shite not manager to blame . Team selection was poor Rangnick was always right people making fun of him is a disgrace absoutlety feel for the guy this team needs more signings this means #QatarIn and #Glazersout RELIVING THE OLE DAYS ! ! ! FUCK THIS SHIT ! ! ! #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow It\\'s not Liverpool being great it\\'s United been shit . 5 of their goals we gave them making stupid mistakes . #GlazersOutNow #QatarIn They are playing FIFA against us . This is pathetic and this is exactly what those mother fuckers the Glazers bring to our club ! ! ! We have to show them we DEMAND THEM OUT ! ! ! #GlazersOut #QatarIn #AntiGlazer I ve said it again and again this squad needs a complete rebuild We have some good players and a few great ones the rest simply can ’ t hang on this level #ManchesterUnited #MUFC #MUFC #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow I think if there\\'s one criticism I have for ETH is his loyalty to Antony . He presses well but his predictability in favoring his left foot makes him easier to defend against . I do think Sancho deserves an extended run . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow Absolutely needed this result #GlazersOutNow Im disgusted , get Qatar here NOW #QatarIn Fuck this shit man 😡 #GlazersOut #QatarIn #MUFC Just blow the whilst now . #GlazersOutNow #QatarIn Nope ... the Glazers . #GlazersOutNow After hyping #ManUtd and Ten Hag in recent months , likes of and will suddenly start blaming #Glazers for this thrashing Sell the team because l always say we need five sensible new players in our team … #GlazersSellManUtd We needed this for the Glazers to go . After the Carabao Cup they started thinking about staying because everything went our way . #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd #MUFC Embarrassing . Are heads are just gone . And questions need to be asked as to why ... #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd #QatarIn Please make it happen ! 🙏 🇶 🇦 ❤ ️ Come on boys . You lost the game on the field . Don\\'t lose your heads & get yourself sent off or suspended . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow Okay nothing can be done about this one . Dust ourselves off and seriously this lot need a hiding next time . No man what the actual ... #GlazersOutNow The Glazers better fuck right off now all their fault the pigs #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNOW Safe to say , I\\'m gonna head to slumberland since it is 2.05 am rn . This quad substitution feels like a pre season friendly atmosphere . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow the #glazersout protesters n drunk agressive #mufc so called true fans are leaving early , ironic they called #ronaldo for leaving a game already won 2 mins early , them plastics are a disgrace to #manutd no woner they not wanted at #oldtrafford , #glazers before them fans #livmun Nice reality check for the players #LIVMUN #ManchesterUnited #manunited #manutd #MUFC #MUFC_FAMILY #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtd Don ’ t forget don ’ t blame ten haag only the glazers #GlazerOut #GlazersOutNOW #GlazersSellManUtdNow Ten Hag wanted both Nunez and Gakpo now they are killing us 😭 😭 #GlazersOutNow Some of these liverpool fans 😭 they haven ’ t been supporting their clubs when they lose but today they all do now don ’ t they 🤣 #GlazersOut #MUFC #MUFC_FAMILY #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow At the end of the day , we are getting beaten by 2 players we desperately wanted to sign but in true Manchester United fashion we didn\\'t . It\\'s easy to get at the players and manager but it\\'s simply a snowball effect from the terrible ownership . #GlazersOutNow Get those Yellow and Green scarfs out #GlazersOutNow We ’ ve let ourselves down massively defensively and a piss poor performance and we need this takeover #MUFC #QatarIn #GlazersOut United players are spoilt brats and ungrateful AF ... I can\\'t believe what I\\'m seeing ... you can\\'t do that honestly ... it\\'s disgusting . #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow #disgust Lmao can ’ t even make them run 50 miles tomorrow bc all the games they played recently ten hag should run them own his Own , QATAR can ’ t come quick enough for me too bring back serious Changes in summer football is a humbler 📸 #mufc This is why momentum needed to build after last week for the Qataris . Hurry up so that they can actually bring us back . #MUFCTakeover #QatarIn It starts at the top #GlazersOutNow 🔰 🔰 🔰 5 nought . Memories of that Newcastle defeat in what was it ? 97 ? The one where Albert chipped Schmeichel . It\\'s a bad day at the office . The miles are adding up . Let\\'s not lose our heads over this . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow Ten hag does not deserve this . #GlazersOut #QatarIn Absolute disgrace #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/lVtgNg7Tig and you fucking #Glazers better get the fuck out ! #GlazersOutNow Fuck this , absolutely disgraceful #GlazersOutNow Fernandes the cry baby #GlazersOut #QatarIn ten Hag targets 3-0 Glazers #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/r6lQW0cF3m Honestly Bruno should zip it . Don\\'t need an unnecessary booking in a lost cause . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow This is really bad ! ! We are being humiliated by Liverpool ! This is a scary thought ! ! Whenever they talk about us being in a title race , we Lose ! Every Time ! ! Liverpool showed up ! We didn\\'t ! We need new owners ! ! NOW ! ! #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtd #LIVMUN We need Qatar now 😭 😭 #QatarIn Come on Bruno . That\\'s plain embarassing . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow Hindsight being 20/20 perhaps AWB & Malacia would be better picks today . Fred\\'s energy would be better fit for this game but perhaps Sabitzer\\'s quality would have made a difference . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow United this year is a prime example of how ownership can make or break a season . Not buying in January + playing 3 matches a week is hurting them . #GlazersOutNow A big derby game and we decided not to turn up for this one . A reminder to keep calm for all the pre match talks . BTW Glazers , please sell asap . Turns out the player manager wanted to sign in the winter window is turning us over #MUFC #GlazersOutNow Looks like it\\'s #GlazersOutNow tonight ? ? That mere fact that the club continues to be owned by useless Americans is the reason why we deserve this sort of abuse #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/zWORpuCqa3 Embarrassment today , shows how much work needs to be done . #GlazersOut #QatarIn the blame for no #gakpo is the #glazersout protesters drunk agressive #mufc so called true fans , #glazers if selling #manutd like them fans been protesting about wasnt going to spend money on something they get no return on , sooner #glazers price them fools out the better #livmun It was 4-0 last season . It\\'s 4-0 now . Ten Hag obviously unhappy as he gestured over something there . A lesson in taking your chances today . The Bruno & Rashford missed chances magnified ever so greatly with every goal they concede . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow We never were idky fan ’ s thought we were fanbase needed a humbling #QatarIn You think ? #glazersout 🔰 #GlazersSellManUtd #GlazersOutNow Ten Hags gonna kill some of these tomorrow #Glazersout #GlazersSellManUtd #QatarIn Let\\'s begin #GlazersOutNow 😭 If only the #glazers would have #signed the #football #player Cody #gakpo then we would not be in this mess ! ! ! Managers fault today . It was obvious the team selection and strategy was wrong and he refused to change until the game was lost . But let\\'s not forget the Glazers whose ownership left us broke and unable to sign . #GlazersOutNow Don\\'t know what McTominay could do to avoid the collision there . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow I love the way you speal the truth only #GlazersOut #QatarIn Antoninho thinks he is ronaldinho . But what he does not understand is that he is a SOAT . Shitties Of All Time #SOAT #GlazersOut #QatarIn ten Hag targets 3-0 Glazers #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/fU4GsfN7It ten Hag\\'s targets 3-0 Glazers #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/XQ634pZuBF ten Hag targets 3-0 Glazers #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/XOAbUjC8Oy 😑 Of course it\\'s Cody Gakpo ! A guy that Manchester United were reportedly interested in when the January transfer window was open . #MUFC #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow #LIVMUN #PLonUSA ⚽ ️ https://t.co/xVrpROkzXS Also to those saying this isn ’ t on the glazers then think again , ETH wanted Gakpo , Glazers said no to spending the money ! Their incompetence to back the manager is costing us consistently ! #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow 10 hag should put maguire to attacking position so we can this game this instint ! #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow All credit to you misers for not signing him . #GlazersOutNow Shaw missed the WH game due to injury . Casemiro limped at the start of the game . Varane had to pass a fitness test today . Cut them some slack over one bad day . How quickly some of the \" fans \" turn on the team is scary #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow ten Hag targets 2 - 0 Glazers #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/O2dNS6lp8k What is happening ? #GlazersOut #QatarIn I will say this , ETH really can spot a player . Even the players who don\\'t play for United come up trumps . The latest example of the glazer family fucking us over though ! 😥 #MUFC #LIVMUN #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/5KvbjilO21 the drunk agressive #mufc so called true fans #glazersout protesters complain #manutd didnt sign #gakpo , #manunited had #ronaldo at #oldtrafford to the fools demanded him out then complain need a forward after sayin #glazers wouldnt spend any money , they got their wish #livmun Come on folks . It\\'s Liverpool at Anfield . Understandable to be frustrated but remember these players been playing every 3 or 4 days for 2 months straight . Garnacho & McTominay on for Weghorst & Fred . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow What an absolute shower of shite ... all over this pitch and now mctossimay comes on ffs Can it get any wersa #GlazersOutNow #EnoughIsEnough The Glazers made Liverpool win this game by letting Liverpool get ten hags number 1 January target #GlazersOutNOW #QatarIn We need Qatar ! ! ! #MUFC Lmao it ’ s like it ’ s all against us . While we ’ re getting killed with Weghorst at striker Sesko goes and scores for his team , the two players we wanted but got cucked on are dominating us . Fuck the Glazers . #Glazersout #AniGlazer #QatarIn Is this the day when the fatigue is finally catching up with these players ? #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow if #glazersout #QATARIN sooner , gakpo would be in united shirts right now . its contridicting the #glazersout , you can buy a #manutd ticket n get drunk in #oldtrafford , but you cant buy a keyring from the megastore , also them fans say #mufc wont win anything with #glazers but won every trophy possible , no wonder its a laughing stock , #livmun #GlazersOutNow dirty scum need to never come back ! ! #GlazersOut #murtoghout #arnoldout #murtoghout #arnoldout Casemiro & Varane clearly off the pace today . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow Typical that the player Ten Hag wanted in January has sunk us . Instead we make to with a Burnley striker on loan . Get the Glazers Out . #LIVMUN 😡 #GlazerOut #GlazersOutNow And this is turning into a bloodbath no one ever saw coming #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow The negotiations are continuing but there are still people who believe that #Qatar\\'s government is the one tryin to get #MUFC . Well , it\\'s not . And any articles you see claiming that #Qatar\\'s government is the one trying to acquire #MUFC are also incorrect , it\\'s a private entity form the country that\\'s actually trying to get it . FFS . Got back to the telly & already 2 down ? #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow A wake up call that we\\'re still far from where we need to be . Need #GlazersOut and #QatarIn Let\\'s see who will acquire #MUFC ... If it\\'s Sheik Jassim , then it\\'s him and his group , not #Qatar\\'s government . If this bid pulls through we should remember that it\\'s not #Qatar as a country who\\'s buying #MUFC . No , not me 🤣 🤣 👍 #GlazersSellManUtd For me for the second half … . AWB on for Dalot , Sancho on for WW . Move Bruno into his normal position and a better balance . #GlazersAreVermin #GlazersDoOneNow #GlazersOutNow I am encouraged by the chances we had after settling in . It\\'s a matter of taking them when they\\'re served onto you . This is a different vintage so you still feel you\\'re in with a chance till the fat lady sings . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow The obvious change for me would be AWB for Dalot to shore up the right . I might sacrifice Antony to bring on Sabitzer pushing Bruno to the right . Garnacho & Sancho would be handy in the last 30 mins . Beyond that , bench lacks options . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow Shaw hasn\\'t been running at TAA while Rashford been dropping deep as has Weghorst . Antony furthest forward most of the time . I still feel AWB is better suited to counter Robertson\\'s surging runs . Gakpo ran behind space Dalot left to cut in unchallenged . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow If we\\'re at OT I\\'d probably be nonplussed by scoreline . Anfield is a whole different proposition altogether . Played well in patches & should\\'ve been clinical with our chances . Highlights the need for a finisher extraordinaire we\\'ve been yearning for . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNOW 2-1 still on Dhruv 👍 👍 🇾 🇪 🇾 🇪 #Comonutd #GlazersSellManUtd All this to play Weghorst as no10 coz the Glazers bottled Gakpo . #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/9fSYeW6bGg Substitutions needed second half . #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtdNow #QatarIn 🇶 🇦 Important to pay attention to the fact that who is trying to buy #MUFC is not #Qatar as a country but one of their private investment groups . The one that our manager desperately wanted but the Glazers refused to sign ? #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/wge544aqWd That Gakpo goal is entirely on the Glazers . Get out of our club now ! ! ! #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/XTDhG8htRy That Gakpo goal is on the Glazers . #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/n82v3DFcdi Honestly I know people want to protect Antony but he\\'s awful in the final third , garnacho should be starting over Antony , simple . #ManchesterUnited #ManUnited #ManUtd #MUFC #LIVMUN #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow If we hadn\\'t conceded like that I would have been very happy with that first half . Nearly another ETH masterclass . No need to panic , regroup stay patient and stay calm . Again though we have missed good chances that could cost us . #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow #MUFC_FAMILY https://t.co/jllIXgRvBw WAKE UP DAMMIT ! WE NEED TO WIN THIS ! COME ON UNITED #GLAZERSSELLNOW #GLAZERSOUTNOW Poor from Antony . He really needs to work on his right foot crossing if he\\'s gonna continue on the right . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow Thanks #Glazers ten Hag wanted Gakpo and you stuck your hands in your pockets as always and said “ no money for you ” and he fucking scores on United . Hurry up and sell the club you fucking parasites #GlazersAreVermin #GlazersDoOneNow #GlazersOut This is where Liverpool is dangerous . Gakpo cutting in to his right & slots it in . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow Unnecessary Antony . Don\\'t need to egg the ref to book . #LIVMUN #GGMU #GlazersOutNow Today I am feeling Qatari ! ! ! #Glazersout #QatarIn Can\\'t see this breakneck speed continuing in the 2nd half . Liverpool doing a lot of running while Utd are better in terms of chances . #LIVMUN #GGMU #GlazersOutNow Wth was Dalot thinking trying to belt that ball ? #LIVMUN #GGMU #GlazersOutNow Casemiro a li\\'l too casual in his own box there . #LIVMUN #GGMU #GlazersOutNow Great chances for United . Need to take some of these ... #MUFC #MUFC_FAMILY #GlazersSellManUtd You can guarantee Liverpool will get a dodgy penalty at Anfield ! They always get them there . #GlazersOut #QatarIn Utd on the cosh from the get go . 75 mins of this would not be good for the heart . #LIVMUN #GGMU #GlazersOutNow Let\\'s fucking go boys ! #LIVMUN #GGMU #GlazersOutNow Come on lads !

it  FFS  Got back to the telly  already 2 down  LIVMUN GlazersOutNow A wake up call that were still far from where we need to be  Need GlazersOut and QatarIn Lets see who will acquire MUFC  If its Sheik Jassim  then its him and his group  not Qatars government  If this bid pulls through we should remember that its not Qatar as a country whos buying MUFC  No  not me 🤣 🤣 👍 GlazersSellManUtd For me for the second half …  AWB on for Dalot  Sancho on for WW  Move Bruno into his normal position and a better balance  GlazersAreVermin GlazersDoOneNow GlazersOutNow I am encouraged by the chances we had after settling in  Its a matter of taking them when theyre served onto you  This is a different vintage so you still feel youre in with a chance till the fat lady sings  LIVMUN GlazersOutNow The obvious change for me would be AWB for Dalot to shore up the right  I might sacrifice Antony to bring on Sabitzer pushing Bruno to the right  Garnacho  Sancho would be handy in the last 30 mins  Beyond that  bench lacks options  LIVMUN GlazersOutNow Shaw hasnt been running at TAA while Rashford been dropping deep as has Weghorst  Antony furthest forward most of the time  I still feel AWB is better suited to counter Robertsons surging runs  Gakpo ran behind space Dalot left to cut in unchallenged  LIVMUN GlazersOutNow If were at OT Id probably be nonplussed by scoreline  Anfield is a whole different proposition altogether  Played well in patches  shouldve been clinical with our chances  Highlights the need for a finisher extraordinaire weve been yearning for  LIVMUN GlazersOutNOW

and all the top teams managers get backed  Because we are a broke joke of a club  managers have to work with 💩 glasers go have to go QatarIn GlasersOut Ah  back to Glazers out   cause if dem pussy deh

clean the team   GlazersOut QatarIn Glazers suddenly want to sell MUFC again  Stop sending me notifications about this match 😭 💀 they really want to spell Manchester    Hopefully this spurs the Glazers to sell the team  That ’ s the only positive am looking at  What if we ’ ve purposely lost this to convince the Glazers to sell  Incase they were having second thoughts  Bloody Hell   MUFC Just go to sleep GlazersOut GlazersSellManutd TimeToSell Well Im speechless  from the talk from the pundits to not being a masochist  Liverpool is teaching DenHaag the finer arts of football  on the

beginning of the year and we was due and crash but my fucking god it couldnt have gone worse than it has today and no matter how tired the players are this performance is fucking embarrassing glazersout GlazersOutNow Absolute disgusting performance  tired or not  MUFC GlazersSellManUtd Let ’ s get the Qatars in asap and start the rebuild    GlazersOutOnceN4All GlazersOutNow GlazersDoOneNow Glazers should be blamed for this  We had Gakpo for 40m  player was willing to come  yet we had 100m to buy Anthony GlazersOut GlazersOutNow Worst performance ever this season  Anyways ETH has done great and we trust him  Loosing to Livershite hurts but the fans should concentrate on GlazerOut GlazersOutNow  We won so many games  players played shite not manager to blame  Team selection was poor

needs a complete rebuild We have some good players and a few great ones the rest simply can ’ t hang on this level ManchesterUnited MUFC MUFC GlazersOut GlazersOutNow I think if theres one criticism I have for ETH is his loyalty to Antony  He presses well but his predictability in favoring his left foot makes him easier to defend against  I do think Sancho deserves an extended run  LIVMUN

Thats plain embarassing  LIVMUN GlazersOutNow Hindsight being 2020 perhaps AWB  Malacia would be better picks today  Freds energy would be better fit for this game but perhaps Sabitzers quality would have made a difference  LIVMUN GlazersOutNow United this year is a prime example of how ownership can make or break a season  Not buying in January  playing 3 matches a week is hurting them  GlazersOutNow A big derby game and we decided not to turn up for this one  A reminder to keep calm for all the pre match talks  BTW Glazers  please sell asap  Turns out the player manager wanted to sign in the winter window is turning us over MUFC GlazersOutNow Looks like its GlazersOutNow tonight   That mere fact that the club continues to be owned by useless Americans is the reason why we deserve this sort of abuse GlazersOut GlazersSellManUtd GlazersOutNow  Embarrassment today  shows how much work needs to be done  GlazersOut QatarIn the blame for no gakpo is the glazersout protesters drunk agressive mufc so called true fans  glazers if selling manutd like them fans been protesting about wasnt going to spend money on something they get no return on  sooner glazers price them fools out the better livmun It was 40 last season  Its 40 now  Ten Hag obviously unhappy as he gestured over something there  A lesson in taking your chances today  The Bruno  Rashford missed chances

GlazersOutNow Ten Hags gonna kill some of these tomorrow Glazersout GlazersSellManUtd QatarIn Lets begin GlazersOutNow 😭 If only the glazers would have signed the football player Cody gakpo then we would not be in this mess    Managers fault today  It was obvious the team selection and strategy was wrong and he refused to change until the game was lost  But lets not forget the Glazers whose ownership left us broke and unable to sign  GlazersOutNow Dont know what McTominay could do to avoid the collision there  LIVMUN GlazersOutNow I love the way you speal the truth only GlazersOut QatarIn Antoninho thinks he is ronaldinho  But what he does not understand is that he is a SOAT  Shitties Of All Time SOAT GlazersOut QatarIn ten Hag targets 30 Glazers GlazersOut GlazersOutNow  ten

January transfer window was open  MUFC GlazersOut GlazersOutNow LIVMUN PLonUSA ⚽ ️  Also to those saying this isn ’ t on the glazers then think again  ETH wanted Gakpo  Glazers said no to spending the money  Their incompetence to back the manager is costing us consistently  GlazersOut GlazersOutNow 10 hag should put maguire to attacking position so we can this game this instint  GlazersOut GlazersOutNow All credit to you misers for not signing him  GlazersOutNow Shaw missed the WH game due to injury  Casemiro limped at the start of the game  Varane had to pass a fitness test today  Cut them some slack over one bad day  How quickly some of the  fans  turn on the team is scary LIVMUN GlazersOutNow ten Hag targets 2  0 Glazers GlazersOut GlazersOutNow  What is happening  GlazersOut QatarIn I will say this  ETH really can spot a player  Even the players who dont play for United come up trumps  The latest example of the glazer family fucking us over though  😥 MUFC LIVMUN GlazersOut GlazersOutNow  the drunk agressive mufc so called true fans glazersout protesters complain manutd didnt sign gakpo  manunited had ronaldo at oldtrafford to the fools demanded him out then complain need a forward after sayin glazers wouldnt spend any money  they got their wish livmun Come on folks  Its Liverpool at Anfield  Understandable to be frustrated but remember these players been playing every 3 or 4 days for 2 months straight  Garnacho  McTominay on for Weghorst  Fred  LIVMUN GlazersOutNow What an absolute shower of shite  all over this pitch and now mctossimay comes on ffs Can it get any wersa GlazersOutNow EnoughIsEnough The Glazers made Liverpool win this game by letting Liverpool get ten hags number 1 January target GlazersOutNOW QatarIn We need Qatar    MUFC Lmao it ’ s like it ’ s all against us  While we ’ re getting killed with Weghorst at striker Sesko goes and scores for his team  the two players we wanted but got cucked on are dominating us  Fuck the

right now  its contridicting the glazersout  you can buy a manutd ticket n get drunk in oldtrafford  but you cant buy a keyring from the megastore  also them fans say mufc wont win anything with

clearly off the pace today  LIVMUN GlazersOutNow Typical that the player Ten Hag wanted in January has sunk us  Instead we make to with a Burnley striker on loan  Get the Glazers Out  LIVMUN 😡 GlazerOut GlazersOutNow And this is turning into a bloodbath no one ever saw coming LIVMUN GlazersOutNow The negotiations are continuing but there are still people who believe that Qatars government is the one tryin to get MUFC  Well  its not  And any articles you see claiming that Qatars government is the one trying to acquire MUFC are also incorrect  its a private entity form the country thats actually trying to get it  FFS  Got back to the telly  already 2 down  LIVMUN GlazersOutNow A wake up call that were still far from where we need to be  Need GlazersOut and QatarIn Lets see who will acquire MUFC  If its Sheik Jassim  then its him and his group  not Qatars government  If this bid pulls through we should remember that its not Qatar as a country whos buying MUFC  No  not me 🤣 🤣 👍 GlazersSellManUtd For me for the second half …  AWB on for Dalot  Sancho on for WW  Move Bruno into his normal position and a better balance  GlazersAreVermin GlazersDoOneNow GlazersOutNow I am encouraged by the chances we had after settling in  Its a matter of taking them when theyre served onto you  This is a different vintage so you still feel youre in with a chance till the fat lady sings  LIVMUN GlazersOutNow The obvious change for me would be AWB for Dalot to shore up the right  I might sacrifice Antony to bring on Sabitzer pushing Bruno to the right  Garnacho  Sancho would be handy in the last 30 mins  Beyond that  bench lacks options  LIVMUN GlazersOutNow Shaw hasnt been running at TAA while Rashford been dropping deep as has Weghorst  Antony furthest forward most of the time  I still feel AWB is better suited to counter Robertsons surging runs  Gakpo ran behind space Dalot left to cut in unchallenged  LIVMUN GlazersOutNow If were at OT Id probably be nonplussed by scoreline  Anfield is a whole different proposition altogether  Played well in patches  shouldve been clinical with our chances  Highlights the need for a finisher extraordinaire weve been yearning for  LIVMUN GlazersOutNOW 21 still on Dhruv 👍 👍 🇾 🇪 🇾 🇪 Comonutd GlazersSellManUtd All this to play Weghorst as no10 coz the Glazers bottled Gakpo  GlazersOut GlazersOutNow  Substitutions needed second half  GlazersOutNow GlazersSellManUtdNow QatarIn 🇶 🇦 Important to pay attention to the fact that who is trying to buy MUFC is not Qatar as a country but one of their private investment groups  The one that our manager desperately wanted but the Glazers refused to sign  GlazersOut GlazersOutNow  That Gakpo goal is entirely on the Glazers  Get out of our club now    GlazersOut GlazersOutNow  That Gakpo goal is on the Glazers  GlazersOut GlazersOutNow  Honestly I know people want to protect Antony but hes awful in the final third  garnacho should be starting over Antony  simple  ManchesterUnited ManUnited ManUtd MUFC LIVMUN GlazersOut GlazersOutNow If we hadnt conceded like that I would have been very happy with that first half  Nearly another ETH masterclass  No need to panic  regroup stay patient and stay calm  Again though we have missed good chances that could cost us  GlazersOut GlazersOutNow MUFCFAMILY  WAKE UP DAMMIT  WE NEED TO WIN THIS  COME ON UNITED GLAZERSSELLNOW GLAZERSOUTNOW Poor from Antony  He really needs to work on his right foot crossing if hes gonna continue on the right  LIVMUN GlazersOutNow Thanks Glazers ten Hag wanted Gakpo and you stuck your hands in your pockets as always and said “ no money for you ” and he fucking scores on United  Hurry up and sell the club you fucking parasites GlazersAreVermin GlazersDoOneNow GlazersOut
