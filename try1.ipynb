Loosing to Livershite hurts but the fans should concentrate on #GlazerOut #GlazersOutNow . We won so many games, players played shite not manager to blame.

FUCK THIS SHIT !!! #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow It\\'s not Liverpool being great it\\'s United been shit. 5 of their goals we gave them making stupid mistakes. #GlazersOutNow #QatarIn They are playing FIFA against us.

We have to show them we DEMAND THEM OUT!!! #GlazersOut #QatarIn #AntiGlazer I ve said it again and again this squad needs a complete rebuild \\nWe have some good players and a few great ones the rest simply can‚Äôt hang on this level #ManchesterUnited #MUFC #MUFC #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow I think if there\\'s one criticism I have for ETH is his loyalty to Antony.

BTW Glazers, please sell @ManUtd asap. Turns out the player manager wanted to sign in the winter window is turning us over #MUFC #GlazersOutNow Looks like it\\'s #GlazersOutNow tonight @GNev2 ?? That mere fact that the club continues to be owned by useless Americans is the reason why we deserve this sort of abuse #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/zWORpuCqa3 Embarrassment today, shows how much work needs to be done. #GlazersOut #QatarIn the blame for no #gakpo is the #glazersout protesters drunk agressive #mufc so called true fans, #glazers if selling #manutd like them fans been protesting about wasnt going to spend money on something they get no return on, sooner #glazers price them fools out the better #livmun It was 4-0 last season.

Last Season #GlazersOutNow Good Morning Reds ‚ô• Ô∏è #mufc #GlazersOut #QatarIn https://t.co/WF6qPboSYp This . The Glazers have emptied the club coffers . ETH has worked miracles but he knew we needed several top-quality reinforcements . #GlazersOutNow You did it right ... we should do that . Back the Manager . Back the players . Back the Team . And #BELIEVE but #GlazersOutNow Shaw has been immense this season , most of our players have , this is just a big blip , they look worn out and fully expect ten hag to drop a few for the next few games , should never lose by that much though , the real message right now though is #GlazersOut #QatarIn That result yesterday is on the Glazers head . They didn\\'t back Erik in the January transfer window knowing full well that we was in 4 competitions and our player\\'s would get burnt out playing 2 games per week . Blame them not Erik . #GlazersOutNow Win , Lose or Draw we continue the fight against the Glazers ! ! ! #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd https://t.co/JkiZd4E5Hb Even if we suffer one more 6-0 or 7-0 or an embarrassment I\\'ll still back Erick Ten Haag as he still didn\\'t get the players he wanted . He wanted a cf and back up mid but he got Bobo and sabitzer . So please don\\'t lose your voice on Glazers out . #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtd You have been very consistent with #GlazersOut I love that still #QatarIn https://t.co/5SQjVwyklB Give us Manchester City\\'s squad depth and this will never happen again . #GGMU #GlazersOutNow It was a tough loss and will not be forgotten , but the future changes the past . For the sake of the future and the return of this club to glories , all fans , especially the English fans , must support the Qatari takeover , otherwise this club will never return #GlazerOut #QatarIn get out you glazer parasites #GlazersOutNow #GlazersOut It was a tough loss and will not be forgotten , but the future changes the past . For the sake of the future and the return of this club to glories , all fans , especially the English fans , must support the Qatari takeover , otherwise this club will never return . #GlazerOut #QatarIn Souness got one back over Sam . I hope everyone especially the players remembers Souness\\'s happy face post match and never be satisfied until we win 95 % of our remaining games ! Take this opportunity to also kick the #GlazersOutNow It was a tough loss and will not be forgotten , but the future changes the past . For the sake of the future and the return of this club to glories , all fans , especially the English fans , must support the Qatari takeover , otherwise this club will never return . #QatarIn #GlazerOut Dont want anywhere near Man Utd another American group looking to bleed Man Utd dry no thanks yanks keep away from OUR Club #GlazersOut #QatarIn Wont surprise if we score 9 against Soton , every year we get thrashed by City and Pool , every year Soton gets 9 . Still feel gutted but we move on . #MUFC #GlazersOutNow A game every 3 days since the world cup no other team have had our schedule , the screwed us with the rearranged games didnt see Arsenal or city having there\\'s done like us . We move on time to get the rats out #GlazersOut #QatarIn retweet this tweet is you want the scumbags out of our football club #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd #fullsaleofmanchesterunited We want #GlazersOut how many bad results in the last 5 years due to their incompetence of not backing the manager so they have depth in the squad . we need these vermon out and #QatarIn Bruno\\'s poor form is due to the fact that he is not playing his position . I don\\'t understand why ETH let him wing after Bruno plays CAM / CM ? We stand firmly behind Bruno , he is a real captain who does his best for the team and does not stop typing and pressing #GlazersOutNow Ten Hag ‚Äô s produced a master stroke for 98 % of this season so far and I ‚Äô m 100 % behind him as our manager , but I never want to see out on that right wing again ! #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtd These toxic fans need to leave this man alone the job he has done with this set of players is incredible #ManchesterUnited #MUFC #Eriktenhag #fakefans #haterscry #ErikTenHag #GlazersOutNOW #manufans Let\\'s look ahead by making sure #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/m2n0SnnvIY Welcome my friend !

For the sake of the future and the return of this club to glories , all fans , especially the English fans , must support the Qatari takeover , otherwise this club will never return . #GlazersOut #QatarIn Was disappointing yesterday , but felt good after listening to that man , Trust the process . for life üí™ üí™ üëπ ‚öî Ô∏è #GlazersSellManUtd If they accept anything other than Qatar , there must be protests of Gargantual proportions . Cuz Qatar will surely offer the best money and if the Glazers sold to anyone else , it\\'s for their benefit and maybe future partnership . #QatarIn Yesterday was such a waste of alcohol and good food üò≠ Me and the boys had this shit planned out , we\\'ll have nice food and drinks , then watch United beat Liverpool üíî #qatarin #GlazersOut #glazers wants money . #qatar got the money .

Bring us Qatar , sell all the deadwood #Qatarin #GlazersOut Sick of hearing \" we are self-sufficient \" bullshit , we will never be as long as we keep paying high interests on our 600m + debt , andwe won\\'t be if we take another billion in loan to rebuild the stadium and facilities .. every penny we make goes back into repayment of dues #QATARIN Our biggest L will always be the Glazers owning UTD ! #QatarIn üá∂ üá¶ THE GLAZERS IS WHAT\\'S GOING ON , they haven\\'t backed Ten hag , we have barely any squad depth , we need #QatarIn ASAP .

Glazers only care about money and players are assets . They wont terminate and lose their assets for free . #QatarIn #mufc 8 shots on target 7 goals and do you still think that #MUFC will be able to make a rebuild without a new goalkeeper ? #MUFC #GlazersOutNow It\\'s now Obvious Erik Ten Haag is performing miracles with some shit players ...

I ‚Äô m confident #Qatarin #GlazersDoOneNow I ‚Äô m so so so angry & frustrated about the manner of the defeat from the players & 10Hag is the first one to take blame for it & it ‚Äô ll take time for me to recover from it BUT I know we ‚Äô ll be back & this üëáüèΩ #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd #MUFC https://t.co/PY3o8WiVci Fellow Manutd fans let\\'s remain committed to our dear club THIS DISAPPOINTMENT WILL COME WITH A BLESSING .. #GlazersOutNow .. https://t.co/p6JcdV7s0e We are aiming for you to rescue us #qatarin #glazers out and Qatar in ! Bloody #glazers https://t.co/pxXAPzAkeM I hope ten hag gives them extra training for that site performance #GlazerOutNOW #GlazersSellManUtd #QatarIn üá∂ üá¶ #GlazersIn #GlazersOut make you\\'re mind up #MUFC #ManchesterUnited #GlazersSellManUtd #GlazersOutNow ü§£ üòÇ https://t.co/AHDcJBos39 Conceding 7 goals isn ‚Äô t the fault of the manager , yes he could have done better with the tactics but look where he has taken us ! This was meant to be a ‚Äò 6 year rebuild ‚Äô and we have a trophy in our first season , chill #backthemanager #GlazersOutNow #GlazersOut #MUFC They have put the club in debt . They are constantly taking money out of the club and putting it in their pocket . Any money we spend comes from the clubs revenue , not Glazer money , putting us further into debt . They are criminals and vermin . #GlazersOutNow #GlazersOutNow will soon be trending . I trust United fans üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ I tell you what this sould be trending right now #GlazersOutNow Horrendous result .. Never thought united lose 7-0 ... Move ON .. Top 4 and one more trophy would end up good season for United and Ten Hag . All we want is #GlazerOut and #QatarIn before end of season . #MUFC Qatar can ‚Äô t even save #MUFC We need #QatarIn asap Good ... we come back to reality ... can\\'t get to top with Glazers ... hope it accelerates the process #QatarIn Erik ten Hag and you need to be together and to get us back to true glory . You will be the perfect combination to get back to how we should be . Please do your very best to oust the #greedyglazers #GlazersOutNow The Glazer family do nothing for #MUFC they are destroying ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/ewpB59FFw8 If internal sources are to be believed both Sir Jim and Al Thani have now reduced their offer for #mufc by 500million for glazers .. üòÑ üòÑ #LIVMUN #glazers One positive from this loss is hope this accelerates the sale of club . Glazers have left us high & dry and we have been competing with loan signings and injured players in 4 competitions . #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow It\\'s not the manager or the players fault , it lies deeper , yes they\\'ve spent 100 \\' s of millions over the years and had some of the best managers but they\\'ve made the great club rotten #GlazersOutNow #GlazersOut I love ETH but 7:0 against Liverpool is a sackable offense . No excuse . We ‚Äô ll see this kind of action often when Qatar takeover the club . Brace yourself for that , guys . #MUFC #GlazersOutNow More pressure on glazers to fck off faster now so there is that , we\\'ll take the L and move on ! #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtd One game ‚Ä¶ stop acting like this is happening every weekend . And if Qatar even think about a new manager , then they can stay the fuck away from Manchester United ! #mufc https://t.co/AKoKJNhoGY I won ‚Äô t be joining some of the fan base in going after #ETH decision . What he has done in the last 7months no one could ever have dreamt we would be where we are .. he will deal with the players and thats the end of it . Keep supporting the club and #GlazersOutNow #GGMU #MUFC Back the manager ! But I hope they all run 100km tomorrow #GLAZERSSELLNOW #GLAZERSOUTNOW #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd bad loss but I am not actually that upset it was a freak result and if we get proper owners and back our manager no doubt we ‚Äô ll bounce back Yo #Glazers , you lot need to invest a lot to take this team to where it belongs . So do the smart thing , take the money and F off #GlazersOut #MUFC BRING ME QATAR RIGHT NOW #MUFC On another note these players are exhausted . We need squad depth . #GlazersOut #QatarIn I hope #TheGlazers are happy to see their true size after such a horrible experience with Liverpool today .. #GLAZERSOUTNOW Hahha funny how #mufc lose and #glazers out come out ! ! ! ü§£ ü§£ ü§£ ... we #lfc smashed ya ... go back in to hiding and come back next year Wrong tactic ‚Äô s should have changed on halftime but we learn and move on much work to be done and not to forget #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtd #Qatarin Ten Hag I believed in you man , how the fuck do you play Weghorst and Fred in the same midfield at Anfield ü§¶\\u200d‚ôÇ Ô∏è I ‚Äô m still gonna wait for Qatar to give you your own players tho #mufc https://t.co/8WENPges4g This is so shocking . This game proves how much the glazers have ruined this club by not getting the squad depth and a proper 9 and most importantly getting out our club . #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtd #Qatarin Typical that the player Ten Hag wanted in January has sunk us . Instead we make to with a Burnley striker on loan . Get the Glazers Out . #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow Qatar in ‚Ä¶ lets go .. spend like crazy #MUFC Only Qatar can fix this shit . #Qatarin #GlazersOut Wow ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ at least the #Glazers will def want to sell $ MANU now ! ü§Ø üòÜ https://t.co/V8QrojsEIL https://t.co/1hRVS7gSr0 These parasites needs to f * * * off ASAP ! ! !

ETH and all the players deserve to be sacked . #GlazersOutNow #MUFC Can\\'t believe that the player we wanted in January humbled us . Instead , we going a player from Burnley . Fuck the Glazers , Fuck them out , #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow ESPECIALLY after today , every fan should be on this . Today happened because of the lack of quality depth . The Glazers are to blame for it . #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/SOHPVb2ChG Tonight will be engraved in the memory of every Manchester United fan . I won\\'t blame the players , and I wouldn\\'t blame the coach .

Inshallah it happens üôèüèª #MUFC The fans might channel the anger to #GlazersOutNow I hope I\\'m wrong üòÇ üòÖ Players are playing 2 games a week some week three . They are humans also .

Make #GlazersOutNow happen https://t.co/6m4aoX411B This result would ‚Äô ve NEVER happened if we were owned by #QatarIn I\\'ve always said that a new manager would only paper over the cavernous cracks at Utd under the parasitic #Glazers . This was brutally and humiliatingly exposed by Liverpool today . #GlazersOut next up for Manchester United is Real Betis In the UEFA Europa League first leg at home on Thursday we must get ready for that game #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd Ha every time they lose its the #glazers fault - what a strange fan base Shocking from the players some of them gave up . They need told if you play for this club you never give up . I am sure Ten Hag will sort that out . Would not be surprised if he played that team again against betis #MUFC #GlazersOut #qatarin Now the public eye is on us I think it ‚Äô s time we stress that we need #GlazersOutNOW Absolutely fucking shambles United ! ! ! #GlazersOut #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow #GlazersOutNow #GlazersOutNow #GlazersOutNow #ManchesterUnited #ManUnited #MUFC üö® BREAKING NEWS üö® Qatar have withdrew their bid #MUFC #LIVMUN https://t.co/7EPxJSFaSt United till I die .

This was a matter of time . Kind of poetic to receive 4 goals from the players Ten Hag desperately wanted . Good reminder something NEEDS to change . #MUFC #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow Ain\\'t no fucking way I seen people say ten hag out you fucking nob heads #GlazersSellManUtd #GlazersOut Win , Lose or Draw , always #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtd #GlazersAreVermin https://t.co/r0pVLffWHQ ETH got carried away ...

Personally I think the #Glazers in partnership with Erik ten Hag are doing a cracking job at #ManU now I wonder how they are doing against #LFC Season over lucky to get top 6 pathetic shower of üí© players . More depth in a puddle #GlasersOut look at Chelsea and City and all the top teams managers get backed . Because we are a broke joke of a club , managers have to work with üí© glasers go have to go #QatarIn #GlasersOut Ah ... back to Glazers out . .. cause if dem pussy deh did spend inna January ... Gakpo would\\'ve been in Manchester . Fuck outta here . #GlazersOutNow So 7-0 . Do people still think that glazers are only problem . I think when qatar buys the team , then they will clean the team ! ! #GlazersOut #QatarIn #Glazers suddenly want to sell #MUFC again . Stop sending me notifications about this match üò≠ üíÄ they really want to spell Manchester ! ! ! Hopefully this spurs the #Glazers to sell the team ! That ‚Äô s the only positive am looking at ! What if we ‚Äô ve purposely lost this to convince the #Glazers to sell ? Incase they were having second thoughts ? Bloody Hell ? ! #MUFC Just go to sleep #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManutd #TimeToSell Well I\\'m speechless ... from the talk from the pundits to not being a masochist ... #Liverpool is teaching #DenHaag the finer arts of football ... on the only positive note . I hope the #Glazers choke Need #QatarIn tomorrow , behead half these mongs and start over We playing Rugby today . #Glazersout #GlazersellManchesterUnited #GlazersoutNow #GGMU #GlazerOut #glazers sell now At least we can now put the pressure back on #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNOW . This is a sign we should have made signings in Jan . So far off it . We have played every 3-4 days since the beginning of the year and we was due and crash but my fucking god it couldnt have gone worse than it has today and no matter how tired the players are this performance is fucking embarrassing #glazersout #GlazersOutNow Absolute disgusting performance , tired or not ! #MUFC #GlazersSellManUtd Let ‚Äô s get the Qatars in asap and start the rebuild ! ! ! #GlazersOutOnceN4All #GlazersOutNow #GlazersDoOneNow Glazers should be blamed for this . We had Gakpo for 40m , player was willing to come , yet we had 100m to buy Anthony #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow Worst performance ever this season . Anyways ETH has done great and we trust him . Loosing to Livershite hurts but the fans should concentrate on #GlazerOut #GlazersOutNow . We won so many games , players played shite not manager to blame . Team selection was poor Rangnick was always right people making fun of him is a disgrace absoutlety feel for the guy this team needs more signings this means #QatarIn and #Glazersout RELIVING THE OLE DAYS ! ! ! FUCK THIS SHIT ! ! ! #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow It\\'s not Liverpool being great it\\'s United been shit . 5 of their goals we gave them making stupid mistakes . #GlazersOutNow #QatarIn They are playing FIFA against us . This is pathetic and this is exactly what those mother fuckers the Glazers bring to our club ! ! ! We have to show them we DEMAND THEM OUT ! ! ! #GlazersOut #QatarIn #AntiGlazer I ve said it again and again this squad needs a complete rebuild We have some good players and a few great ones the rest simply can ‚Äô t hang on this level #ManchesterUnited #MUFC #MUFC #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow I think if there\\'s one criticism I have for ETH is his loyalty to Antony . He presses well but his predictability in favoring his left foot makes him easier to defend against . I do think Sancho deserves an extended run . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow Absolutely needed this result #GlazersOutNow Im disgusted , get Qatar here NOW #QatarIn Fuck this shit man üò° #GlazersOut #QatarIn #MUFC Just blow the whilst now . #GlazersOutNow #QatarIn Nope ... the Glazers . #GlazersOutNow After hyping #ManUtd and Ten Hag in recent months , likes of and will suddenly start blaming #Glazers for this thrashing Sell the team because l always say we need five sensible new players in our team ‚Ä¶ #GlazersSellManUtd We needed this for the Glazers to go . After the Carabao Cup they started thinking about staying because everything went our way . #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd #MUFC Embarrassing . Are heads are just gone . And questions need to be asked as to why ... #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd #QatarIn Please make it happen ! üôè üá∂ üá¶ ‚ù§ Ô∏è Come on boys . You lost the game on the field . Don\\'t lose your heads & get yourself sent off or suspended . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow Okay nothing can be done about this one . Dust ourselves off and seriously this lot need a hiding next time . No man what the actual ... #GlazersOutNow The Glazers better fuck right off now all their fault the pigs #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNOW Safe to say , I\\'m gonna head to slumberland since it is 2.05 am rn . This quad substitution feels like a pre season friendly atmosphere . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow the #glazersout protesters n drunk agressive #mufc so called true fans are leaving early , ironic they called #ronaldo for leaving a game already won 2 mins early , them plastics are a disgrace to #manutd no woner they not wanted at #oldtrafford , #glazers before them fans #livmun Nice reality check for the players #LIVMUN #ManchesterUnited #manunited #manutd #MUFC #MUFC_FAMILY #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtd Don ‚Äô t forget don ‚Äô t blame ten haag only the glazers #GlazerOut #GlazersOutNOW #GlazersSellManUtdNow Ten Hag wanted both Nunez and Gakpo now they are killing us üò≠ üò≠ #GlazersOutNow Some of these liverpool fans üò≠ they haven ‚Äô t been supporting their clubs when they lose but today they all do now don ‚Äô t they ü§£ #GlazersOut #MUFC #MUFC_FAMILY #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow At the end of the day , we are getting beaten by 2 players we desperately wanted to sign but in true Manchester United fashion we didn\\'t . It\\'s easy to get at the players and manager but it\\'s simply a snowball effect from the terrible ownership . #GlazersOutNow Get those Yellow and Green scarfs out #GlazersOutNow We ‚Äô ve let ourselves down massively defensively and a piss poor performance and we need this takeover #MUFC #QatarIn #GlazersOut United players are spoilt brats and ungrateful AF ... I can\\'t believe what I\\'m seeing ... you can\\'t do that honestly ... it\\'s disgusting . #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow #disgust Lmao can ‚Äô t even make them run 50 miles tomorrow bc all the games they played recently ten hag should run them own his Own , QATAR can ‚Äô t come quick enough for me too bring back serious Changes in summer football is a humbler üì∏ #mufc This is why momentum needed to build after last week for the Qataris . Hurry up so that they can actually bring us back . #MUFCTakeover #QatarIn It starts at the top #GlazersOutNow üî∞ üî∞ üî∞ 5 nought . Memories of that Newcastle defeat in what was it ? 97 ? The one where Albert chipped Schmeichel . It\\'s a bad day at the office . The miles are adding up . Let\\'s not lose our heads over this . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow Ten hag does not deserve this . #GlazersOut #QatarIn Absolute disgrace #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/lVtgNg7Tig and you fucking #Glazers better get the fuck out ! #GlazersOutNow Fuck this , absolutely disgraceful #GlazersOutNow Fernandes the cry baby #GlazersOut #QatarIn ten Hag targets 3-0 Glazers #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/r6lQW0cF3m Honestly Bruno should zip it . Don\\'t need an unnecessary booking in a lost cause . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow This is really bad ! ! We are being humiliated by Liverpool ! This is a scary thought ! ! Whenever they talk about us being in a title race , we Lose ! Every Time ! ! Liverpool showed up ! We didn\\'t ! We need new owners ! ! NOW ! ! #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtd #LIVMUN We need Qatar now üò≠ üò≠ #QatarIn Come on Bruno . That\\'s plain embarassing . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow Hindsight being 20/20 perhaps AWB & Malacia would be better picks today . Fred\\'s energy would be better fit for this game but perhaps Sabitzer\\'s quality would have made a difference . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow United this year is a prime example of how ownership can make or break a season . Not buying in January + playing 3 matches a week is hurting them . #GlazersOutNow A big derby game and we decided not to turn up for this one . A reminder to keep calm for all the pre match talks . BTW Glazers , please sell asap . Turns out the player manager wanted to sign in the winter window is turning us over #MUFC #GlazersOutNow Looks like it\\'s #GlazersOutNow tonight ? ? That mere fact that the club continues to be owned by useless Americans is the reason why we deserve this sort of abuse #GlazersOut #GlazersSellManUtd #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/zWORpuCqa3 Embarrassment today , shows how much work needs to be done . #GlazersOut #QatarIn the blame for no #gakpo is the #glazersout protesters drunk agressive #mufc so called true fans , #glazers if selling #manutd like them fans been protesting about wasnt going to spend money on something they get no return on , sooner #glazers price them fools out the better #livmun It was 4-0 last season . It\\'s 4-0 now . Ten Hag obviously unhappy as he gestured over something there . A lesson in taking your chances today . The Bruno & Rashford missed chances magnified ever so greatly with every goal they concede . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow We never were idky fan ‚Äô s thought we were fanbase needed a humbling #QatarIn You think ? #glazersout üî∞ #GlazersSellManUtd #GlazersOutNow Ten Hags gonna kill some of these tomorrow #Glazersout #GlazersSellManUtd #QatarIn Let\\'s begin #GlazersOutNow üò≠ If only the #glazers would have #signed the #football #player Cody #gakpo then we would not be in this mess ! ! ! Managers fault today . It was obvious the team selection and strategy was wrong and he refused to change until the game was lost . But let\\'s not forget the Glazers whose ownership left us broke and unable to sign . #GlazersOutNow Don\\'t know what McTominay could do to avoid the collision there . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow I love the way you speal the truth only #GlazersOut #QatarIn Antoninho thinks he is ronaldinho . But what he does not understand is that he is a SOAT .

A guy that Manchester United were reportedly interested in when the January transfer window was open . #MUFC #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow #LIVMUN #PLonUSA ‚öΩ Ô∏è https://t.co/xVrpROkzXS Also to those saying this isn ‚Äô t on the glazers then think again , ETH wanted Gakpo , Glazers said no to spending the money ! Their incompetence to back the manager is costing us consistently ! #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow 10 hag should put maguire to attacking position so we can this game this instint ! #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow All credit to you misers for not signing him . #GlazersOutNow Shaw missed the WH game due to injury . Casemiro limped at the start of the game . Varane had to pass a fitness test today . Cut them some slack over one bad day . How quickly some of the \" fans \" turn on the team is scary #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow ten Hag targets 2 - 0 Glazers #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/O2dNS6lp8k What is happening ? #GlazersOut #QatarIn I will say this , ETH really can spot a player . Even the players who don\\'t play for United come up trumps . The latest example of the glazer family fucking us over though ! üò• #MUFC #LIVMUN #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/5KvbjilO21 the drunk agressive #mufc so called true fans #glazersout protesters complain #manutd didnt sign #gakpo , #manunited had #ronaldo at #oldtrafford to the fools demanded him out then complain need a forward after sayin #glazers wouldnt spend any money , they got their wish #livmun Come on folks . It\\'s Liverpool at Anfield . Understandable to be frustrated but remember these players been playing every 3 or 4 days for 2 months straight . Garnacho & McTominay on for Weghorst & Fred . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow What an absolute shower of shite ... all over this pitch and now mctossimay comes on ffs Can it get any wersa #GlazersOutNow #EnoughIsEnough The Glazers made Liverpool win this game by letting Liverpool get ten hags number 1 January target #GlazersOutNOW #QatarIn We need Qatar ! ! ! #MUFC Lmao it ‚Äô s like it ‚Äô s all against us . While we ‚Äô re getting killed with Weghorst at striker Sesko goes and scores for his team , the two players we wanted but got cucked on are dominating us . Fuck the Glazers . #Glazersout #AniGlazer #QatarIn Is this the day when the fatigue is finally catching up with these players ? #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow if #glazersout #QATARIN sooner , gakpo would be in united shirts right now . its contridicting the #glazersout , you can buy a #manutd ticket n get drunk in #oldtrafford , but you cant buy a keyring from the megastore , also them fans say #mufc wont win anything with #glazers but won every trophy possible , no wonder its a laughing stock , #livmun #GlazersOutNow dirty scum need to never come back ! ! #GlazersOut #murtoghout #arnoldout #murtoghout #arnoldout Casemiro & Varane clearly off the pace today . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow Typical that the player Ten Hag wanted in January has sunk us . Instead we make to with a Burnley striker on loan . Get the Glazers Out . #LIVMUN üò° #GlazerOut #GlazersOutNow And this is turning into a bloodbath no one ever saw coming #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow The negotiations are continuing but there are still people who believe that #Qatar\\'s government is the one tryin to get #MUFC . Well , it\\'s not . And any articles you see claiming that #Qatar\\'s government is the one trying to acquire #MUFC are also incorrect , it\\'s a private entity form the country that\\'s actually trying to get it . FFS . Got back to the telly & already 2 down ? #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow A wake up call that we\\'re still far from where we need to be . Need #GlazersOut and #QatarIn Let\\'s see who will acquire #MUFC ... If it\\'s Sheik Jassim , then it\\'s him and his group , not #Qatar\\'s government . If this bid pulls through we should remember that it\\'s not #Qatar as a country who\\'s buying #MUFC . No , not me ü§£ ü§£ üëç #GlazersSellManUtd For me for the second half ‚Ä¶ . AWB on for Dalot , Sancho on for WW . Move Bruno into his normal position and a better balance . #GlazersAreVermin #GlazersDoOneNow #GlazersOutNow I am encouraged by the chances we had after settling in . It\\'s a matter of taking them when they\\'re served onto you . This is a different vintage so you still feel you\\'re in with a chance till the fat lady sings . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow The obvious change for me would be AWB for Dalot to shore up the right . I might sacrifice Antony to bring on Sabitzer pushing Bruno to the right . Garnacho & Sancho would be handy in the last 30 mins . Beyond that , bench lacks options . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow Shaw hasn\\'t been running at TAA while Rashford been dropping deep as has Weghorst . Antony furthest forward most of the time . I still feel AWB is better suited to counter Robertson\\'s surging runs . Gakpo ran behind space Dalot left to cut in unchallenged . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow If we\\'re at OT I\\'d probably be nonplussed by scoreline . Anfield is a whole different proposition altogether . Played well in patches & should\\'ve been clinical with our chances . Highlights the need for a finisher extraordinaire we\\'ve been yearning for . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNOW 2-1 still on Dhruv üëç üëç üáæ üá™ üáæ üá™ #Comonutd #GlazersSellManUtd All this to play Weghorst as no10 coz the Glazers bottled Gakpo . #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/9fSYeW6bGg Substitutions needed second half . #GlazersOutNow #GlazersSellManUtdNow #QatarIn üá∂ üá¶ Important to pay attention to the fact that who is trying to buy #MUFC is not #Qatar as a country but one of their private investment groups . The one that our manager desperately wanted but the Glazers refused to sign ? #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/wge544aqWd That Gakpo goal is entirely on the Glazers . Get out of our club now ! ! ! #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/XTDhG8htRy That Gakpo goal is on the Glazers . #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow https://t.co/n82v3DFcdi Honestly I know people want to protect Antony but he\\'s awful in the final third , garnacho should be starting over Antony , simple . #ManchesterUnited #ManUnited #ManUtd #MUFC #LIVMUN #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow If we hadn\\'t conceded like that I would have been very happy with that first half . Nearly another ETH masterclass . No need to panic , regroup stay patient and stay calm . Again though we have missed good chances that could cost us . #GlazersOut #GlazersOutNow #MUFC_FAMILY https://t.co/jllIXgRvBw WAKE UP DAMMIT ! WE NEED TO WIN THIS ! COME ON UNITED #GLAZERSSELLNOW #GLAZERSOUTNOW Poor from Antony . He really needs to work on his right foot crossing if he\\'s gonna continue on the right . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow Thanks #Glazers ten Hag wanted Gakpo and you stuck your hands in your pockets as always and said ‚Äú no money for you ‚Äù and he fucking scores on United . Hurry up and sell the club you fucking parasites #GlazersAreVermin #GlazersDoOneNow #GlazersOut This is where Liverpool is dangerous . Gakpo cutting in to his right & slots it in . #LIVMUN #GlazersOutNow Unnecessary Antony . Don\\'t need to egg the ref to book . #LIVMUN #GGMU #GlazersOutNow Today I am feeling Qatari ! ! ! #Glazersout #QatarIn Can\\'t see this breakneck speed continuing in the 2nd half . Liverpool doing a lot of running while Utd are better in terms of chances . #LIVMUN #GGMU #GlazersOutNow Wth was Dalot thinking trying to belt that ball ? #LIVMUN #GGMU #GlazersOutNow Casemiro a li\\'l too casual in his own box there . #LIVMUN #GGMU #GlazersOutNow Great chances for United . Need to take some of these ... #MUFC #MUFC_FAMILY #GlazersSellManUtd You can guarantee Liverpool will get a dodgy penalty at Anfield ! They always get them there . #GlazersOut #QatarIn Utd on the cosh from the get go . 75 mins of this would not be good for the heart . #LIVMUN #GGMU #GlazersOutNow Let\\'s fucking go boys ! #LIVMUN #GGMU #GlazersOutNow Come on lads !

I am encouraged by the chances we had after settling in  Its a matter of taking them when theyre served onto you  This is a different vintage so you still feel youre in with a chance till the fat lady

handy in the last 30 mins  Beyond that  bench lacks options  LIVMUN GlazersOutNow Shaw hasnt been running at TAA while Rashford been dropping deep as has Weghorst  Antony furthest forward most of the
